## Supervised Machine Learning
### Project: House Prices Prediction

____________

### 1. Classification Housing Prices
#### 1.1. Business Problem

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames(USA), this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

- **Create a model to predict whether a house is expensive or not.** 

- **The metric used for this project will be Accuracy Score.**

#### 1.2. Steps of the Project

Application of the entire things can be broken down into following parts:

*   1- Reading data & First glance
*   2- Data Pre-processing & Cleaning
*   3- Splitting Data into Training and Test Set
*   4- Creating Pipeline
*   5- Applying algorithms
*   6- Comparing the accuracy scores
*   7- Using the Model on the Test Data

### 2. Regression: Predicting Housing Prices
#### 2.1. Business Problem
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames(USA), this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

- **Create a model to predict the exact price of a house.**
- **The metric used for this project will be RMSE.**
